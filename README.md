# api-fetcher
React-native application for fetching  dog API https://dog.ceo/dog-api/. 
I used Expo Go to run the react-native app on my phone.
I went to this website https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup to create app.
For running this api-fetcher app you should download Expo Go on app store or google play and sign in or log in if already have an account.
